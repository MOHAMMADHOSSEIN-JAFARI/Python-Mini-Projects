Write a program that reads the age of parliamentary candidates from the input and prints the age of the largest of them in the output. Your program will continue reading from the input until negative number one is entered. As soon as this number appears in the input, the program should stop reading the input and print the largest age. The age of people is in the range of 10 to 90 years.
